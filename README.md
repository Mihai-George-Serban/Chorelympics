# Chorelympics

I'd like to make a change to see if it works properly.

## Project name

Choose a name for your project. Don’t worry, it doesn’t need to be fancy, it’s just a way to identify it (e.g. "Hipstacam", or "Woofie").

**Answer: Chorelympics**

## Repository

Create a public GitHub repo to host your project and paste its URL here.

**Answer: https://github.com/Mihai-George-Serban/Chorelympics**

## One liner

Write a very short sentence (< 10 words) that describes what your app is about (e.g. "Airbnb for boats", or "Movies recommendation engine").

**Answer: Jira for Chores, for competitive households**

## Project description

Provide a short description of what the app does (< 1000 characters).

**Answer: In its final form, the app should allow users to log in, create/join a household and compete against other household members to be on the top of the leaderboard and claim the weekly household reward they have set. The rewards are decided by the household. Some standard chores would be available by default, but chores can be added, edited, removed and assigned duration and difficulty stats for point rewards calculation.**

## MVP

Choose the core feature that most defines your app and you’ll start to tackle first (e.g. "Users should be able to take a picture of a food item with their smartphone and receive a list of recipes based on that ingredient").

**Answer: User will be able to visit the app, see a list of pre-seeded chores, assign chores to their name and mark them as completed for the current week. Leaderboard should update with total points.**

## Tech stack

Does your app have a client, a server, or both? If it has a client, is it web or mobile? What frameworks, databases, or relevant libraries are you going to use? Fill the fields here below as needed.

**Front End: React, CSS**

**Back End: Javascript, Express, MongoDB**

## Data sources

In case your app relies on some data to work properly, where are you planning to get that data from?

**Answer: The plan is to have a database with a few potential tables, based on growing complexity (1 for starters)**
